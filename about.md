~~I'm gonna something write here, not yet today. Maybe tomorrow.. :)~~

I'm Ali, I live in Gebze. I work as a fullstack developer at Atilim Yazilim for one year (I started working after graduation)

I have some skills about web developing especially JavaScript. I can write Vanilla JS with ES6 standarts. I'm still using jQuery. Because of we've legacy codes. I love writing JavaScript, Python .

## I used these technologies:

### in web development

	- Front End:
		- AngularJS
		- VueJS
		- jQuery
		- Vanilla JS
		- Bootstrap
		- PureCSS
	- Backend:
		- PHP
		- Asp.NET MVC / WebForms
		- Python (Just a hobby)
		- MySQL / MSSQL / MongoDB / PostgreSQL

### in desktop development (about 7-8 years ago)

	- Desktop:
		- C# / WinForms with DevExpress (in Windows)
		- Vb.NET / WinForms with DevExpress

## Hobbies

I like classical music. I like physics, even if I don't understand. As you can see, My English isn't very good. I'm trying to improve My English.
